\title{Box-Cox Transform Function}
\usage{
boxcox.transform(x, lambda = 0, makepos = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector that is to be transformed under the box-cox function.}

\item{lambda}{strength of the transformation. Default is 0. May be a single value or a vector for this function.}

\item{makepos}{the constant value that should be added to each `x`  to make them positive. Default is 0.}
}
\value{
A vector of the values that have been transformed. If lambda is a 0 value, returns the `log(x)`. If lambda is non-0 value, returns `(x^lamba - 1) / lambda`. When lambda is a vector, a marrix of values that were transformed with each column of the matrix corresponds to a lambda.
}
\description{
Given a variable, the Box-Cox power transformation is obtained.
