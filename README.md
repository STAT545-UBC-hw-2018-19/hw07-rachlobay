# Homework 07: Building your own R package

This is the repository for STAT547 HW 07 which focuses on building my own package.

The aim is to hit the following elements for this assignment:

1) Define and export one new function. I made three new functions that were exported and two more internal functions. All were relating to box-cox power transformations.

2) Give functions sensible defaults, where relevant.

3) Document all exported functions.

4) Include at least 3 tests for the new function that test common cases that I anticipate of the function. I made three new tets for all the exported functions that I created. 

5) Ensure that the package passes `check()` without errors (warning are fine, however). This part was a pain, but eventually, I got the pass on `check().

6) Update the README.md and vignette to show the usage of all functions in the package. Done and done. See the vignette for slightly more in-depth examples. 

7) Make sure that the instructions tell a person how to install the package. See the README.Rmd file in the powers folder on Github for this part.
