# Homework 07: Building your own R package

This is the repository for STAT547 HW 07 which focuses on building my own package.

The aim is to hit the following elements for this assignment:

1) Define and export one new function.

2) Give functions sensible defaults, where relevant.

3) Document all exported functions.

4) Include at least 3 tests for the new function that test common cases that I anticipate of the function.

5) Ensure that the package passes `check()` without errors (warning are fine, however).

6) Update the README.md and vignette to show the usage of all functions in the package.

7) Make sure that the instructions tell a person how to install the package.
